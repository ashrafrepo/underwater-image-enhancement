# A Challenging Dataset for Underwater Image Enhancement (CDUIE)
A common challenge in the research of image enhancement is the availability of real-world data. This real-world underwater dataset is very challenging for state-of-the-art image enhancement models due to the severe degradation in the captured images added by the extremely turbid lake environment and low-light conditions. The collected dataset contains 100 RGB underwater images from three different geographical locations, namely Lake Linden, Chassell Bay, and Portage Lake in Michigan, USA. The images are separated based on depth into three groups:
1) images taken at a depth of less than one meter (D1).
2) images taken at a depth of one-two meters (D2).
3) images taken at a depth of two-three meters (D3).

The Geneinno T1 Pro[1] Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) shown in the figure below is used to collect the images at a resolution of 3840Ã—2160 pixel.

The specifications of the CMOS camera that is equipped on the ROV are also shown in the table below.

Sample images from the three proposed depths are shown in the figure below where the effect of even such a minor depth difference can be clearly and easily noticed on the three groups of images.
